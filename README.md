# ICP3M

Part (a)
1. Generate and Reshape Random Vector
   - Generates a random vector of size 15 with integers between 1 and 20, and reshapes it into a 3x5 matrix.

2. Create 4x3 Integer Array
   - Creates a 4x3 integer array and prints its shape, type, and data type.

3. Replace Maximum in Each Row with 0
   - Replaces the maximum value in each row of the reshaped 3x5 matrix with 0.

Part (b)
Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
   - Computes and prints the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a given 2x2 matrix.

Part (c)
Sum of Diagonal Elements
   - Computes and prints the sum of the diagonal elements of a given 2x2 matrix.

Part (d)
Reshape Array to New Shapes
   - Reshapes an array of 6 elements into 3x2 and 2x3 matrices without altering the data.
